# projects
This is a collection of my projects I do in my free time.

The naming of the folders is intented to be the heading of what the general purpose or idea of the small projects or experiments I do. <br> 
I will be documenting what I do in each folder for the sake of clarity, but will not go in depth with the theory for everything I make or try out, unless it seems necessary.
